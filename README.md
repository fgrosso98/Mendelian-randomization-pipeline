This folder contains the codes used to perform the main Mendelian randomisation analyses. The files in the "***GWAS QC***" folder were first used to correct missing values using the 1000 Genomes European reference file and other corrections related to my GWAS specifically.
The MR analysis described in the "***MR_analysis***" folder was then carried out and the codes for it are found there.
